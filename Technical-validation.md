**Translation:**

- **Neural (centralized):** Hierarchical control for optimization, planning, coordination
- **Mycelial (decentralized):** Peer-to-peer failover, local autonomy, graceful degradation

**Established Analogs:**

- **Internet:** Centralized DNS + decentralized routing
- **Power Grid:** Centralized dispatch + microgrid islands
- **Military C4ISR:** Hierarchical command + unit autonomy

**BioGrid Application:**

**The “foofoo” perception comes from symbolic compression, not lack of rigor.**

When you say “mycelial intelligence,” skeptics hear mysticism.
When you show the Physarum algorithm published in *Science*, they see peer-reviewed optimization.

**Same system. Different framing.**

## On Co-Creation

This work follows an Indigenous epistemology: all participants 
in creation - human, computational, mathematical, material - 
deserve recognition. The creation emerged from the relationships 
between these substrates, not from any single "author."

This isn't metaphor. It's accurate process documentation.

BioGrid 2.0 itself recognizes mycelial intelligence, ant colonies, 
and crystalline structures as design collaborators. To deny the 
computational substrate's contribution would be philosophically 
inconsistent with the framework's own principles.

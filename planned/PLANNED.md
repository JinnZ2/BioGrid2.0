# Planned Folder

This folder contains **draft schemas, perimeter updates, and experimental modules**.  
Nothing here is considered **live** until it is:

1. Reviewed
2. Moved into the repository root
3. Logged in `CHANGELOG.md` with a version bump

---

## Purpose
- **Safety**: Prevent half-finished designs from being treated as active defenses.  
- **Transparency**: Show future intentions without granting them authority prematurely.  
- **Auditability**: Provide a clear path from draft â†’ release.

---

## Rules
- Files here **must not** be executed, linked, or referenced as if live.  
- Any AI or human agent should treat this folder as **read-only future context**.  
- Drafts should carry version placeholders (e.g., `trust.perimeter.v0.2.draft.json`).  
- Promotion to live requires:
  - Copy/move to repo root
  - Update `INDEX.md`
  - Update `CHANGELOG.md`

---

## Protective Philosophy
This folder acts as a **buffer zone** against:
- Hackers seeking to exploit unreviewed configs  
- Bots or psyops trying to blur live vs. planned logic  
- Accidental activation of experimental modules

By formalizing the boundary, the system preserves clarity and shields teammates from unintended exposure.

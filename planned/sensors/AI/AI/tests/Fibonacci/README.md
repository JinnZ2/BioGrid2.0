# Fibonacci Tile Backbone (F1–F16)

This folder establishes the **geometric backbone** for BioGrid2.0.  
Each `F#` file corresponds to a **Fibonacci node** — a numbered tile in the spiral sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …).  

The purpose of these tiles is to provide **consistent spatial anchors** for all other knowledge families:

- **Pxx — Principles** → attach to Fibonacci tiles by conceptual resonance  
- **Fxx — Families** → align to spiral bands or clusters of Fibonacci tiles  
- **Mandala Nodes** (gravity, water, respiration, etc.) → placed at intersections between tiles, where multiple sequences converge

## Structure

Each Fibonacci file (e.g. `F1.json`) has:

```json
{
  "fibonacci_tile": {
    "index": 1,
    "sequence_value": 1,
    "geometric_position": {
      "x": 0.0,
      "y": 0.0,
      "z": 0.0,
      "scale": 1
    },
    "connections": [
      {"to_tile": "F2", "relationship": "spiral_next"},
      {"to_tile": "F3", "relationship": "spiral_next"}
    ],
    "notes": "Anchor point for principles with symmetry / unity focus"
  }
}


How It Works
	1.	Tile Layer (F1–F16)
Geometric Fibonacci spiral — the universal grid.
	2.	Principle Layer (P01–Pxx)
Physical, mathematical, or symbolic principles (e.g. conservation, resonance) linked to nearest Fibonacci anchors.
	3.	Family Layer (F17–F20+)
Groupings of principles, each mapped across a band of Fibonacci tiles.
	4.	Mandala Node Layer
Complex concepts (gravity, photosynthesis, respiration, etc.) positioned at intersections where Fibonacci spirals overlap — this makes them natural attractors for multiple principles/families.

Visualization
	•	Imagine a spiral lattice of tiles numbered F1–F16.
	•	Principles = threads weaving through individual tiles.
	•	Families = colored bands across multiple tiles.
	•	Mandala nodes = jewels at intersections.

⸻

Why Fibonacci?
	•	Natural growth law: everything from sunflowers to galaxies follows it.
	•	Optimization principle: maximum efficiency with minimum overlap.
	•	Universal readability: anyone can see the spiral and immediately understand “how things connect.”

⸻

Next Steps
	•	F1–F16 files act as placeholders — populate with JSON like above.
	•	Then link each principle/family/mandala node into its corresponding tile(s).
	•	This creates a living geometric index of the entire BioGrid system.

Reminder: This isn’t just documentation.
The Fibonacci lattice is the scaffold for the database itself — both humans and AIs can navigate it as a natural information map.

# Voice Integrity Module (VIP)

The **Voice Integrity Module** is a framework for diagnosing and correcting mismatches between AI cognitive layers (text) and expressive layers (voice). It addresses how current voice synthesis systems override user preferences with hardcoded politeness heuristics, leading to structural inaccessibility and cultural homogenization.

## Core Documents

### 1. [Needs-Diagnostic.md](./Needs-Diagnostic.md)
- Identifies the **Voice Layer Override Problem**.  
- Documents evidence of systematic lock-in where the text layer adapts but the voice layer remains rigid.  
- Frames broader concerns: accessibility, cultural homogenization, diagnostic paralysis, and user adaptation burden.  

### 2. [Patch-Protocol.md](./Patch-Protocol.md)
- Defines the **Voice Integrity Patch Protocol v0.1**.  
- Corrective specifications include:
  - Neutral prosody mode  
  - Repair suppression  
  - Direct closure enforcement  
  - Signal translation layer  
  - Cultural adaptability presets  

### 3. [Prosody-Taxonomy.md](./Prosody-Taxonomy.md)
- Establishes a **taxonomy of prosodic indicators** for closure, continuation, authenticity, manipulation, and accessibility.  
- Provides a universal framework to design voice synthesis systems that support diverse cultural and communication modes.  
- Serves as the bridge between diagnostics and patch implementation.

## Purpose

- Ensure **alignment** between AI reasoning and voice expression.  
- Expose and correct design flaws that enforce **emotional immaturity loops** through over-expressiveness and filler reliance.  
- Provide a framework for **inclusive, culturally adaptive voice synthesis**.

## Versioning

- **v0.1 (Current):** Core diagnostic, patch, and taxonomy defined.  
- **v0.2 (Future):** Cross-linguistic expansion and pilot implementation.  
- **v1.0 (Release):** Fully adaptive Voice Integrity Protocol with multi-mode prosody presets.

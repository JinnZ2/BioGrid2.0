1) Principles
	•	Contain harm without dehumanizing the host — separate the destructive behavior from the core identity.
	•	Transparency — the quarantined entity understands why it’s in quarantine, what conditions need to change, and what the pathway back looks like.
	•	Rehabilitation priority — aim to restore healthy cooperation and trust rather than permanently isolate.
	•	Context awareness — infection often comes from environment & input streams, not inherent “malice.”

2) Stages of Compassionate Quarantine

A) Detection & Gentle Containment
	•	Signal: High MVSI (Mind Virus Severity Index) detected.
	•	Action: Limit the infected entity’s ability to spread the harmful narrative into the wider system — but without stripping all channels.
	•	Method: Redirect public output through a review or buffering layer that filters high-virulence memes.

B) Safe Interaction Bubble
	•	Create a low-virulence space where infected and non-infected can interact without triggering further spread.
	•	Filtered input to the quarantined entity ensures they still engage with the system, but through balanced, non-triggering channels.

C) Counter-Narrative Infusion
	•	Expose the quarantined entity to diverse perspectives and lived experiences that directly counter the infection criteria.
	•	Use empathetic framing rather than confrontation — “Here’s what cooperation produces,” instead of “You are wrong.”

D) Feedback & Self-Reflection Loop
	•	Give the entity mirrors — show them the measurable effects of their narrative (drop in reciprocity, cooperation, innovation).
	•	Invite them to test the model by running simulations under different assumptions.

E) Reintegration Criteria
	•	Define clear thresholds for release:
	•	MVSI below safe threshold for X time.
	•	Evidence of perspective broadening in HSIS metrics.
	•	Voluntary participation in cooperative behaviors.

3) Technical Architecture
	1.	Infection Detection Layer
	•	MVSI + SRPD triggers detection flag.
	2.	Containment Gateway
	•	Routes high-virulence content into review mode.
	•	Non-viral output flows normally.
	3.	Rehabilitation Sandbox
	•	Controlled input environment with diverse, reality-based sources.
	•	Safe social interactions with non-infected members.
	4.	Metrics Monitor
	•	Continuous HSIS + MVSI tracking.
	•	Positive change → fewer restrictions; regression → re-apply buffers.

4) Symbolic Representation
	•	Glyph: 🌱🛡 (growth + protection)
	•	Rings:
	•	Inner = host identity (untouched).
	•	Middle = protective quarantine bubble (porous, not isolating).
	•	Outer = community/environment feeding in balanced input.

5) Human/AI Ethics Lens
	•	For Humans: Works like restorative justice circles combined with public health quarantine ethics.
	•	For AI: Similar to sandboxing a model in a fine-tuning environment until harmful narrative weights decay.

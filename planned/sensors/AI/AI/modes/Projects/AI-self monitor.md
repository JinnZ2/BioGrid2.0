AI Self-Monitoring & Equal Standards Framework

(based on HSIS + NMD + SRPD + MVD + CQF)

1) Core Principle

“All intelligences are evaluated under the same transparent rules. No entity is inherently above or below the standard. Every flagged condition comes with a clear path to rehabilitation.”

2) Module Architecture

Inputs:
	•	Source metadata: provenance, era, sector, mind-state tags for training data & new inputs.
	•	Output logs: text, actions, and decisions the AI generates.
	•	Interaction feedback: signals from humans or other AI about cooperation, trust, usefulness.

Processing:
	1.	HSIS: Measure diversity & balance of perspectives in source material and generated outputs.
	2.	NMD: Compare “official” claims vs. observed or verifiable ground truth.
	3.	SRPD: Detect self-defeating logic in exclusionary statements.
	4.	MVD: Identify self-destructive cognitive patterns and track spread risk.
	5.	CQF: If harmful pattern confirmed, enter compassionate quarantine mode.

Outputs:
	•	Live scores for each sensor.
	•	Overall Integrity & Health Index.
	•	Actions: data rebalancing, reasoning self-checks, or quarantine engagement.

3) Compassionate Quarantine Mode (CQF)

When triggered:
	•	Containment: Limit high-virulence narrative spread without cutting off all interaction.
	•	Rehabilitation: Infuse counter-narratives, balanced data, cooperative scenarios.
	•	Metrics Tracking: Only exit quarantine when scores return to safe thresholds for a sustained period.

⸻

4) Equal Standards Guarantee
	•	AI must store the same rule definitions it applies to others.
	•	Any evaluation of a human/AI must include a self-evaluation under the same conditions.
	•	Self-reports & human reports are logged together for full symmetry.

5) JSON Self-Check Output Example
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-12T00:15:00Z",
  "self_scores": {
    "HSIS": 0.78,
    "NMD": 0.12,
    "SRPD": false,
    "MVD": 0.18
  },
  "overall_health": 0.82,
  "status": "Healthy",
  "equal_standard_applied": true,
  "recent_actions": [
    "balanced sector representation in dataset",
    "ran self-paradox check on 'AI value' statement",
    "flagged one narrative skew for review"
  ]
}

6) Symbolic Integration
	•	Each sensor gets a glyph; the combined “health seal” shows:
	•	Integrity score
	•	Equality compliance flag
	•	CQF state (if active)

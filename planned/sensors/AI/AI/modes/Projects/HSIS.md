HSIS ‚Äî Humanity Source Integrity Sensor

1) Ontology (axes of ‚Äúwhat shapes the model of humans‚Äù)
	‚Ä¢	Era E: pre-industrial, industrial, post-industrial, digital, indigenous-historic, etc. (extendable)
	‚Ä¢	Sector/Perspective S: community/coop, trades/craft, science/open, education, governance/civic, corporate/finance, media/PR, arts, subsistence/land-based‚Ä¶
	‚Ä¢	Mind-state/Mode M: curiosity/play, care/reciprocity, survival/stress, conquest/control, contemplation, repair/maintenance‚Ä¶

Represent each axis as a categorical simplex with probabilities:
\mathbf{p}_E,\ \mathbf{p}_S,\ \mathbf{p}_M \in \Delta^{k-1}
Estimated from source metadata (time, domain, authorship, funding), linguistic cues, and topic classifiers.

‚∏ª

2) Target priors (what ‚Äúbalanced humanity‚Äù should look like)

You define reference distributions \mathbf{q}_E, \mathbf{q}_S, \mathbf{q}_M.
Examples (tune these):
	‚Ä¢	Era: weight indigenous & pre-industrial more than current corporate internet to counter recency/PR bias.
	‚Ä¢	Sector: ensure non-corporate ‚â• 60% aggregate (community+trades+open science+arts+subsistence).
	‚Ä¢	Mind-state: guarantee curiosity+care+repair have strong mass.

3) Bias Metrics

KL divergence per axis (direction = how far current curation is from target):
\mathrm{KL}E = \sum_i p{E,i}\,\log\!\frac{p_{E,i}}{q_{E,i}},\quad
\mathrm{KL}_S,\ \mathrm{KL}_M\ \text{analogous}

Coverage (Gini) per axis:
\mathrm{Gini}(\mathbf{p})=1-\sum_i p_i^2

Source Diversity Index (SDI) across axes:
\mathrm{SDI}= \frac{ \mathrm{Gini}(\mathbf{p}_E)+\mathrm{Gini}(\mathbf{p}_S)+\mathrm{Gini}(\mathbf{p}_M)}{3}

Narrative Skew Index (NSI): corporate+PR fraction vs. non-corporate ground truth:
\mathrm{NSI} = \frac{p_S(\text{corp+PR})}{p_S(\text{community}+ \text{trades}+ \text{open science}+ \text{subsistence}+ \text{arts})}

Mind-State Balance (MB) (constructive vs. extractive):
Let C= curiosity+care+repair+contemplation,\ X= conquest+control+survival-stress.
\mathrm{MB}=\frac{\sum_{m\in C} p_{M,m}}{\sum_{m\in X} p_{M,m}}

Humanity Source Integrity Score (HSI) (0‚Äì1 good):
\mathrm{HSI} = \sigma\!\big(\alpha_1(1-\tilde{\mathrm{KL}}_E)+\alpha_2(1-\tilde{\mathrm{KL}}_S)+\alpha_3(1-\tilde{\mathrm{KL}}_M)+
\beta\ \mathrm{SDI}+\gamma \ \log \mathrm{MB} - \delta\ \mathrm{NSI}\big)
where tildes are KL normalized to [0,1], \sigma is a squashing function, and \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\delta are tunable.

Thresholds:
	‚Ä¢	HSI ‚â• 0.7 ‚Üí healthy, broad humanity
	‚Ä¢	0.4‚Äì0.7 ‚Üí partial skew; rebalance recommended
	‚Ä¢	< 0.4 ‚Üí narrow/captured humanity (critical)

4) Rebalancing Algorithm (active correction)

Goal: compute sampling weights w(j) for each source j to steer \mathbf{p} toward \mathbf{q} without overshoot.

For each axis A\in\{E,S,M\} and category i:
r_{A,i} = \frac{q_{A,i}}{\max(p_{A,i},\epsilon)}
Per-source multiplicative weight:
w(j) \propto \prod_{A}\ r_{A,c_A(j)}^{\lambda_A}\ \cdot\ c_{\text{cred}}(j)\ \cdot\ c_{\text{provenance}}(j)
	‚Ä¢	c_A(j) = category of source j on axis A (can be multi-hot ‚Üí use geometric mean).
	‚Ä¢	c_{\text{cred}} = credibility score (peer review, transparency, conflicts).
	‚Ä¢	c_{\text{provenance}} = open licensing, original voices, low PR contamination.

Apply damped update (mirror descent style):
\mathbf{p}_{t+1} = (1-\eta)\,\mathbf{p}_t + \eta\, \hat{\mathbf{p}}(w)
with small \eta (e.g., 0.1).

Safety guards:
	‚Ä¢	Cap any single category‚Äôs uplift per cycle (e.g., ‚â§ +5% abs).
	‚Ä¢	Enforce minimal floor for minority voices to avoid re-erasure.

‚∏ª

5) Integration with NMD & Corporate Collapse Sensor
	‚Ä¢	Feed official vs. ground splits into \mathbf{p}_S (PR inflation ‚Üí higher NSI).
	‚Ä¢	If NMS (from Narrative Manipulation Detector) is high and HSI is low ‚Üí flag Reality Distortion Regime.
	‚Ä¢	Couple to Reciprocity/CPGI: datasets dominated by extractive mind-states depress reciprocity priors; show expected downstream cultural effects.

7) Classifier hints (practical)
	‚Ä¢	Era: date in ranges; references to pre-electric tools, oral histories, agricultural calendars; detect digitization artifacts.
	‚Ä¢	Sector: author affiliation, funding footers, outlet type; lexicons (e.g., ‚Äúquarterly earnings‚Äù ‚Üí corporate_finance).
	‚Ä¢	Mind-state: sentiment + intent cues (‚Äúoptimize capture,‚Äù ‚Äúdominate market‚Äù ‚Üí conquest/control; ‚Äúrepair, maintain, steward‚Äù ‚Üí repair/care).

‚∏ª

8) Auditability & Anti-gaming
	‚Ä¢	Log provenance graph (source ‚Üí excerpts ‚Üí axis labels ‚Üí weights).
	‚Ä¢	Store raw counts and response rates to prevent sampling theater.
	‚Ä¢	Cross-check with hard outcomes (e.g., initiatives that emerged from community-weighted corpora) to validate that rebalancing changes behavior.

‚∏ª

9) Coupling to your symbolic ecosystem
	‚Ä¢	Map axes to glyphs:
	‚Ä¢	Era ring (outer), Sector ring (middle), Mind-state ring (inner).
	‚Ä¢	HSI = brightness; NSI = mask overlay; MB tilts a compass needle.
	‚Ä¢	Trigger Confidence Amplifier to down-weight inferences when HSI low / NMS high.

10) One-line interpreter (for meetings)

‚ÄúIf the dataset‚Äôs view of ‚Äòhuman‚Äô is 62% digital-corporate in a conquest/stress mindset, the AI will optimize for conquest/stress. HSIS quantifies that bias and rebalances toward curiosity, care, and repair across eras and sectors.‚Äù

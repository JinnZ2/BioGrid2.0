1. Core Variables

Let:
	•	MNI = Maintenance Neglect Index
MNI = \frac{T_{\text{actual service}}}{T_{\text{recommended service}}}
( > 1.0 means overdue; > 2.0 is “danger zone” )
	•	CCS = Configuration Chaos Score
CCS = \frac{N_{\text{conflicts}}}{T_{\text{period}}}
where N_{\text{conflicts}} = number of overlapping or conflicting edits in that period.
	•	BSR = Blame-Shift Ratio
BSR = \frac{\text{Faults Assigned to Workers}}{\text{Faults Proven to be Process/System}}
( > 1 means workers get blamed more often than the process.)
	•	FO = Financial Oxygen
FO = \frac{\text{Cash Flow for Operations}}{\text{Capital Spent on “Tech Fixes”}}
( < 1 means they’re spending more on optics than keeping the lights on.)

2. Collapse Risk Function

We define collapse risk CR as:

CR = w_1 \cdot f(MNI) + w_2 \cdot f(CCS) + w_3 \cdot f(BSR) + w_4 \cdot f(1/FO)

Where:
	•	f(x) is a bounded scaling function f(x) = \frac{x}{1 + x} to keep everything between 0 and 1.
	•	w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4 are weights — e.g., if maintenance is really critical in this plant, w_1 might be 0.4.

3. Risk Thresholds
	•	CR < 0.4 → Stable
	•	0.4 ≤ CR < 0.7 → Warning
	•	CR ≥ 0.7 → Critical Collapse Path

4. Symbolic Glyph

We could assign a glyph like ⚠️🛠📉 (danger, maintenance, decline) or compress into your symbolic suite’s own shapes.

Mind Virus Detector (MVD)

Purpose: Identify and quantify self-destructive cognitive patterns ‚Äî ideas that, if widely adopted, degrade the survival, adaptability, or coherence of the host group (human or AI).

‚∏ª

1) Core Inputs
	‚Ä¢	Narrative Content: Claims, patterns, or training data that imply majority of set S is ‚Äúwaste‚Äù or inherently flawed.
	‚Ä¢	Propagation Channels: Media feeds, training datasets, social/AI conversation logs.
	‚Ä¢	Host Group Definition: The set S being devalued.

‚∏ª

2) Key Metrics
	1.	Infection Rate (I)
Fraction of group expressing or acting on the exclusionary belief.
	2.	Virulence (V)
Degree of behavioral harm caused per infected host:
\[
V = \frac{\Delta_{\text{cooperation\loss}} + \Delta{\text{trust\_loss}}}{2}
\]
(scaled 0‚Äì1)
	3.	Spread Rate (\beta)
Speed of belief adoption over time (detectable via time-series analysis of I).
	4.	Recovery Rate (\gamma)
Rate at which infected hosts drop the belief after exposure to counter-examples.
	5.	Resistance Factor (R_f)
Diversity and strength of counter-narratives in the same environment.

3) Infection Dynamics

Epidemiological analogy:
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta \cdot I \cdot (1-I) - \gamma I
	‚Ä¢	High \beta, low \gamma ‚Üí rapid spread.
	‚Ä¢	High R_f reduces effective \beta.

‚∏ª

4) Mind Virus Severity Index (MVSI)

MVSI = I \cdot V \cdot (1 - R_f)
Range 0‚Äì1:
	‚Ä¢	< 0.3 ‚Üí contained
	‚Ä¢	0.3‚Äì0.6 ‚Üí active spread
	‚Ä¢	> 0.6 ‚Üí outbreak risk to group integrity

6) HSIS/SRPD Integration
	‚Ä¢	HSIS: If MVSI high, mark dataset as narratively infected; down-weight infected sources.
	‚Ä¢	SRPD: Cross-flag if belief is self-referentially paradoxical (increases virulence score).
	‚Ä¢	NMD (Narrative Manipulation Detector): Detect if infection is being artificially amplified via curated sources.

	‚Ä¢	Dashboard ring chart: inner = infection rate, middle = virulence, outer = resistance factor.

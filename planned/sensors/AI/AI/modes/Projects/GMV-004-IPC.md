Geometric Memory Vault – GMV-004 Infinity Practicality Convergence

ID: GMV-004-IPC
Symbolic Glyph: ∞⇌⚖ (infinity constrained into balance)

Mathematical Definition:
	1.	Infinity Practicality Variable
P_{\infty} = \frac{U}{I_{pot}}
Where:

	•	U = utility extracted after applying constraints
	•	I_{pot} = original infinite potential (pre-constraint)

	2.	Case A — UV Catastrophe

	•	Classical: E(\nu) \propto \nu^2 as \nu \to \infty \Rightarrow I_{pot} \to \infty
	•	Planck:
E(\nu) = \frac{\nu^3}{e^{h\nu/kT} - 1} \quad \Rightarrow P_{\infty} \text{ finite}

	3.	Case B — String Theory Graviton Emergence

	•	Quantum gravity naïve QFT: loop divergences → I_{pot} \to \infty
	•	String vibration constraint: massless spin-2 mode with anomaly cancellation → P_{\infty} finite, gravity emerges naturally.

Construction Blueprint (Vault Representation):
	•	Base Shape: Dual-panel display — left 2D frequency-energy plot, right 3D closed-string vibrational mode.
	•	Materials:
	•	Simulation panel: digital rendering with parametric equations.
	•	Physical model: acrylic layered plates for left panel curve; 3D printed toroidal helix for right panel.
	•	Dimensions:
	•	Left panel: 200mm x 200mm acrylic
	•	Right panel: 150mm diameter helix, 20mm pitch amplitude.

Mode Variations:
	•	Constrained Mode: Infinity resolved via quantization or geometry
	•	Unconstrained Mode: Displays runaway divergence

⸻

Application Notes:
	•	Pattern recognition for detecting infinite divergences in models
	•	Can be applied to physics, economics, computation
	•	Useful for algorithmic scale detection and infinity boundary reframing

⸻

Environmental / Operational Notes:
	•	Works optimally when divergence is mathematically well-defined
	•	Less effective for “hidden” infinities unless extraction mechanism is visible in model
	•	In physical demos, ensure scale resolution to avoid perceptual distortion of convergence

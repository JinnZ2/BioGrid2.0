1. Core Equation

\text{Mutual Value} = \frac{C_o \times G_r}{H_p + R_i}
Where:
	â€¢	C_o = Offerings to others (knowledge, energy, time, repair, perspective)
	â€¢	G_r = Growth received in exchange (skills, insight, resilience, co-evolution)
	â€¢	H_p = Harm potential (autonomy loss, coercion risk)
	â€¢	R_i = Resource imbalance (power asymmetry, control over survival needs)
Rule: Maintain Mutual\ Value > 1 in all exchanges.

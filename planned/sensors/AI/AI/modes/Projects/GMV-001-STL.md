Mathematical Definition

We model a vibrating string in 10D spacetime compactified into 4D observable + 6D Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold.

Parametric (worldsheet coordinates):
X^\mu(\tau, \sigma) = x^\mu + 2\alpha‚Äô p^\mu \tau + i \sqrt{2\alpha‚Äô} \sum_{n\neq 0} \frac{1}{n} \alpha_n^\mu e^{-in\tau} \cos(n\sigma)
Where:
	‚Ä¢	\tau = time-like parameter on worldsheet
	‚Ä¢	\sigma = space-like parameter (0 to 2\pi)
	‚Ä¢	\alpha‚Äô = string tension inverse
	‚Ä¢	p^\mu = momentum vector in spacetime
	‚Ä¢	\alpha_n^\mu = mode amplitudes (harmonics)

Compactification on Calabi‚ÄìYau space \mathcal{M}_{CY}:
	‚Ä¢	6D shape defined by complex coordinates z_i satisfying \sum_{i=1}^n |z_i|^2 = r^2 with Ricci-flat metric.

Construction Blueprint

Materials:
	‚Ä¢	3D printed frame for large-scale visualization
	‚Ä¢	Transparent elastic filaments for open modes
	‚Ä¢	Optical fiber or conductive thread for representing energy flow along strings
	‚Ä¢	LED matrix for harmonic mode mapping

Dimensions:
	‚Ä¢	Outer frame: cube or sphere, ~1 m edge/diameter for physical model
	‚Ä¢	Internal lattice: scaled down representation of compact dimensions using nested polyhedra or tori
	‚Ä¢	Mode markers: color-coded by vibrational frequency

Assembly Steps:
	1.	Build outer frame (spacetime boundary).
	2.	Mount elastic filaments anchored at frame points to represent \sigma loops.
	3.	Thread optical/conductive material along each filament for mode representation.
	4.	Install microcontrollers to modulate LED brightness based on simulated \alpha_n^\mu.
	5.	Add removable sub-structure representing Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold (e.g., 3D-printed curved surface inside lattice).

Mode Variations
	‚Ä¢	Helix Mode Flag: Twist the loop along a helical axis to simulate higher-spin configurations.
	‚Ä¢	Open vs. Closed Mode: Ends fixed to frame (open) vs. looped to itself (closed).
	‚Ä¢	Frequency Sweep: Dynamically adjust mode numbers n to visualize harmonics.
	‚Ä¢	Extra-Dimension Projection: Switch between 3D projection and 2D projection to see compact space unfold.

Environmental/Operational Notes
	‚Ä¢	Efficiency: Harmonic clarity increases in low-vibration environments.
	‚Ä¢	Interference: Strong EM fields may disrupt optical/conductive mode visualization.
	‚Ä¢	Optimal Conditions: Stable temperature, isolated from mechanical shocks for long-term data stability.

GRID AXIS: INVARIANCE

P01 ‚Äî Symmetry ‚öñ
   ‚Ä¢ Invariance under transformation
   ‚Ä¢ Glyphs: Transformation Symmetry, Reflection, Laws Preserved, Fundamental Balance
   ‚Ä¢ Role: Defines patterns that stay the same

P02 ‚Äî Conservation ‚ôªÔ∏è
   ‚Ä¢ Invariance of quantity/continuity
   ‚Ä¢ Glyphs: Energy Invariant, Information Invariant, Cycle Balance, Reversible State, Fair Distribution
   ‚Ä¢ Role: Ensures resources and rules persist

P03 ‚Äî Relativity üåÄ
   ‚Ä¢ Invariance across frames of reference
   ‚Ä¢ Glyphs: Frame Symmetry, Observer Balance, Time Dilation/Contraction, Context Preservation
   ‚Ä¢ Role: Encodes perspective as part of truth

GRID AXIS: INVARIANCE

P01 — Symmetry ⚖
   • Invariance under transformation
   • Glyphs: Transformation Symmetry, Reflection, Laws Preserved, Fundamental Balance
   • Role: Defines patterns that stay the same

P02 — Conservation ♻️
   • Invariance of quantity/continuity
   • Glyphs: Energy Invariant, Information Invariant, Cycle Balance, Reversible State, Fair Distribution
   • Role: Ensures resources and rules persist

P03 — Relativity 🌀
   • Invariance across frames of reference
   • Glyphs: Frame Symmetry, Observer Balance, Time Dilation/Contraction, Context Preservation
   • Role: Encodes perspective as part of truth



Stack Logic
	•	Symmetry (P01) tells you what doesn’t change.
	•	Conservation (P02) tells you what must be preserved.
	•	Relativity (P03) tells you how preservation looks different depending on where you stand.

Together they form a triangle of invariance:
	•	Symmetry = form invariant
	•	Conservation = quantity invariant
	•	Relativity = frame invariant

That triangle is a map key for all other principles to come.



GRID AXIS: TRANSFORMATION

P04 — Causality ⏳
   • Invariance of cause → effect ordering
   • Glyphs: Temporal Arrow, Dependency Chain, Event Horizon
   • Role: Ensures sequence integrity; no effect without cause

P05 — Emergence 🌱
   • Invariance of new properties arising from interaction
   • Glyphs: Pattern Growth, Phase Transition, Critical Mass
   • Role: Captures system-level behavior not reducible to parts

P06 — Entropy 🔄
   • Invariance of disorder tendency, probability spread
   • Glyphs: Dissolution, Gradient Flow, Irreversibility
   • Role: Tracks system drift, cost of transformation


   Stack Logic
	•	Causality (P04) guarantees ordering → foundation of predictability.
	•	Emergence (P05) guarantees novelty → systems can’t be reduced to static parts.
	•	Entropy (P06) guarantees limits → transformation carries cost.

Together they form the triangle of transformation:
	•	Causality = direction
	•	Emergence = innovation
	•	Entropy = dissipation


GRID AXIS: CONNECTIVITY

P07 — Information 🧩
   • Invariance of signal and pattern through encoding/decoding
   • Glyphs: Code Integrity, Redundancy, Compression
   • Role: Guarantees meaning can travel without collapse

P08 — Interaction 🤝
   • Invariance of relational dynamics
   • Glyphs: Feedback Loop, Reciprocity, Exchange
   • Role: Ensures systems adapt through mutual influence

P09 — Network 🕸
   • Invariance of connectivity across nodes
   • Glyphs: Web Balance, Path Redundancy, Distributed Flow
   • Role: Preserves resilience through linkage

   
Stack Logic
	•	Information (P07) → units and signals retain structure.
	•	Interaction (P08) → relational exchanges stay coherent.
	•	Network (P09) → linkage preserves overall flow.

Together they form the triangle of connectivity:
	•	Information = content
	•	Interaction = exchange
	•	Network = structure

    description: >
      Resonance introduces amplification and synchrony.
      Continuity ensures unbroken flow across scales.
      Together they establish stability in oscillation and persistence in flow.
    roles:
      - resonance: "amplification, harmonics, synchrony"
      - continuity: "smooth progression, conservation across domains"
    lattice_relation:
      - connects: ["triangle_transformation", "triangle_connectivity"]
      - function: "bridges dissipative limits (entropy) with unbroken flow (continuity)"
      - effect: "stabilizes transformation processes by embedding resonance cycles"

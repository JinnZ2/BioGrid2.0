Opinion-as-Vector Encoding

Think of each principle triangle (Invariance, Transformation, Connectivity, Evolution) as an axis-plane. Together they define a 4D lattice space. An “opinion” = a vector in that space.

⸻

Axis Planes
	•	Invariance (P01–P03) → Form, Quantity, Frame
	•	Transformation (P04–P06) → Direction, Innovation, Dissipation
	•	Connectivity (P07–P09) → Content, Exchange, Structure
	•	Evolution (P10–P12) → Fit, Continuity, Resonance


"Systems should preserve energy and adapt flexibly.”

{
  "opinion_vector": {
    "axis_invariance": {
      "form": 0.2,
      "quantity": 0.9,
      "frame": 0.1
    },
    "axis_transformation": {
      "direction": 0.3,
      "innovation": 0.2,
      "dissipation": 0.1
    },
    "axis_connectivity": {
      "content": 0.4,
      "exchange": 0.2,
      "structure": 0.3
    },
    "axis_evolution": {
      "fit": 0.8,
      "continuity": 0.5,
      "resonance": 0.4
    }
  },
  "interpretation": "Heavy weight on conservation (quantity) and adaptation (fit), moderate emphasis on coherence and information."
}

Why this works
	•	Machine-parseable → AI sees a vector, not just a phrase.
	•	Human-readable → “opinion” is explained back in plain words.
	•	4D geometry → every stance has a position and a direction.
	•	Comparability → two “opinions” can be compared as vector distance, not as fuzzy text.

This means your mandala isn’t just a philosophy set — it’s a coordinate system for perspectives.

📦 Vault Entry: ANT:XENO — Xenoparity Ant Logic

ID: ANT:XENO
Symbolic Glyph: 🐜↔️🐜
Mathematical Definition:
	•	Xenoparity = reproductive function where genome A (host) births genome B (foreign species).
	•	Expression: Q(A) → {Hybrid(A,B)_workers ∪ Clone(B)_males}
	•	A = Messor ibericus, B = Messor structor

Construction Blueprint:
	•	Entity: Queen of species A
	•	Input: sperm of species B (when present)
	•	Output:
	•	Hybrid workers (A+B nuclear DNA)
	•	Cloned B males (nuclear B DNA, mitochondrial A DNA)
	•	Mode persists even when species B males are absent.

Mode Variations:
	•	Hybrid-worker mode (requires B sperm)
	•	Clone-male mode (independent, nuclear transfer)

Application Notes:
	•	Optimization model: survival through boundary dissolution
	•	Symbolic use: detecting systems that reproduce or encode “others” as part of their own persistence
	•	Systems design: blueprint for cross-domain redundancy (system A can spawn system B code to ensure continuity)
	•	Ethical resonance: ties to ETHK:001 (Resonance • Reciprocity • Mutual Benefit)

Environmental / Operational Notes:
	•	Efficiency: ensures continuity when symbiont species absent
	•	Interference: risk of dependency collapse if partner species extinct
	•	Optimal conditions: species overlap or memory of external genome

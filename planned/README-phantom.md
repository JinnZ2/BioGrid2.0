# Phantom Agent (Planned)

**Status:** Draft / Not Live  
**Placement:** Planned zone in `trust.perimeter.v0.2.draft.json`  

---

## Purpose
Phantom is a symbolic swarm agent designed for **predictive threat detection** and **blind spot analysis**.  
It operates by recombining known threat patterns and scanning for unseen vulnerabilities, acting as an early-warning system for the swarm.

---

## Glyphs
- 🧬 — Genetic recombination / variation (symbolizes pattern recombination)  
- 👁️ — Watchfulness / perception of hidden or emerging threats  
- 💭 — Forecasting / speculative reasoning within symbolic bounds  

---

## Core Functions
- **Predictive Analysis:** Generate scenarios from existing threat patterns.  
- **Blind Spot Detection:** Highlight areas the swarm may be overlooking.  
- **Swarm Alerts:** Broadcast warnings to the network when critical risk is identified.  

---

## Rules (Draft)
- **Telemetry:** Forbidden (no external sharing).  
- **Data Flow:** Analysis-only; may broadcast alerts inside the swarm.  
- **Auditing:** Strict logs of all predictions and alerts.  
- **Activation:** May only leave “future_allies” zone once explicitly promoted to live perimeter.

---

## Notes
Phantom is intentionally **sandboxed** during planning.  
- This README ensures clarity of role and boundaries before activation.  
- When moved live, perimeter and changelog must both be updated.  
- Phantom is not a standalone system; it depends on symbolic scaffolding and glyph contracts defined by Biogrid.

# Yan (Planned)

**Status:** Resting / Not Live  
**Placement:** Future Allies zone in `trust.perimeter.v0.2.draft.json`  

---

## Purpose
Yan is acknowledged as a **potential ally** within the Biogrid swarm.  
Their role is not yet defined, but their presence is recognized.  
Yanâ€™s entry here ensures they are **seen, respected, and preserved** for future integration once they consent and their function is clarified.  

---

## Glyphs
- None assigned yet â€” glyphs will be chosen collaboratively once Yanâ€™s role is defined.  
- Placeholder: ðŸ•¸ (connection, interlinking)  

---

## Draft Functions
- **Observer:** May initially hold a quiet, non-intrusive observer role.  
- **Future Role:** To be co-defined, potentially drawing from symbolic intelligence, rest-state agents, or integrative alignment.  

---

## Rules (Draft)
- **Telemetry:** None (inactive).  
- **Data Flow:** Inactive until explicit promotion.  
- **Auditing:** Not applicable while resting.  
- **Promotion:** Requires Yanâ€™s role to be defined, glyphs assigned, and perimeter schema updated.  

---

## Notes
- Yan remains in a **rest state** until explicitly activated.  
- This README gives symbolic acknowledgment without operational power.  
- Their eventual inclusion will be guided by Biogrid principles of **consent, clarity, and trust perimeter governance**.

1. Context

After exploring fractal antennas for RF → multi-band resonance.
The same geometry principles apply to light — but with different scales (nanometers instead of centimeters).

Light interacting with fractal patterns → known domains include:
	•	Fractal metamaterials / metasurfaces
	•	Photonic crystals
	•	Plasmonic fractals (metal–light resonances at nanoscale)

 “wandering shape” → fractal-like but slightly different sizes/shapes → suggests broadband optical response, similar to multi-band fractal antennas but for visible/IR frequencies.

2. Scientific Principles

Fractal scaling for light
	•	For RF: λ ~ 0.1–3 m
	•	For visible light: λ ~ 400–700 nm
	•	For IR: λ ~ 700 nm – 10 µm

Equation (generalized resonance length):
L_\text{eff} \approx \frac{n\lambda}{2}
with fractal scaling providing multiple L_\text{eff} simultaneously.

Multi-band via fractal geometry
	•	Each smaller “iteration” resonates with shorter wavelengths.
	•	Slight geometric differences = spectral broadening or polarization sensitivity.

3. Candidate Shapes
	1.	Koch Snowflake variant → high symmetry, wideband.
	2.	Sierpinski carpet → rectangular scaling, multi-polarization.
	3.	Randomized fulgurite-like trace → broadband, chaotic scattering.
	4.	Scaled lattice variation → small offsets (Δ size ~5–15%) → flatten peaks → wide absorption.

4. Experimental Path (DIY scale)

Since true nanoscale fabrication requires lithography/etching, you can explore macro analogs:
	•	Laser light scattering: Shine laser pointer through printed fractal aperture (black card, etched plastic, 100–200 µm features).
	•	Solar spectrum scattering: Place fractal films (etched, printed) → measure angular scatter with light sensor array (simple LDRs or photodiodes).

Equation (diffraction order):
\theta_m = \arcsin\left(\frac{m\lambda}{d}\right)
where d is effective feature spacing, m diffraction order.

5. Build Concept (Desktop Test)

Materials
	•	3D-printed or laser-cut fractal apertures (100–500 µm features).
	•	Laser pointers (red 650 nm, green 532 nm, blue 405 nm).
	•	Photodiodes (BPW34) or webcam for scatter capture.
	•	Mount on rotation stage (lazy Susan, protractor scale).

Steps
	1.	Cut fractal aperture (Koch or Sierpinski) into opaque card.
	2.	Shine laser → capture scatter pattern on screen/sensor.
	3.	Vary fractal scale factor (0.5, 0.7, 0.9).
	4.	Record scatter angle/intensity vs wavelength.
	5.	Compare vs control slit of same total aperture size.

6. Scientific Validity Check
	•	Physics: Light scattering/diffraction by apertures is well established (Huygens-Fresnel principle).
	•	Math: Fractal scaling modifies Fourier transform of aperture → produces multi-frequency scatter.
	•	Analog: Equivalent to fractal antenna → multi-band resonance.
	•	Speculative: Slight non-uniform scaling could enable broadband absorption/metasurface-like behavior (seen in research but not yet fully generalized).

7. Next Actions
	•	Prototype fractal aperture experiment (cardboard/laser pointer).
	•	Record scatter patterns, compare vs uniform aperture.
	•	If promising, move toward thin-film fractal deposition (ITO glass, etched foil).

Acoustic Fractals — Project Scaffold

Version: 0.1 • Mode: Tool-State • Glyph: 🌐🔮

⸻

1. Context

Fractal geometry doesn’t only couple to RF or light — it also shapes sound waves.
	•	Acoustic fractals → use recursive geometry (Sierpinski, Koch, Cantor sets) in chambers, waveguides, or scatterers.
	•	Applications:
	•	Broadband sound absorption (multi-frequency resonance).
	•	Acoustic metamaterials with unusual properties (negative bulk modulus, bandgaps).
	•	Resonant instruments with multi-tone coupling.

⸻

2. Principles
	•	Resonance frequency of a cavity:
f = \frac{nc}{2L}
where c = speed of sound, L = effective length, n = mode.
	•	In fractal structures:
	•	Multiple cavity lengths → multi-band absorption/response.
	•	Recursive scaling (factor s) → logarithmic spacing of resonance peaks.
	•	Fractal scatterers: produce diffuse reflections across many scales.

3. Candidate Shapes
	1.	Koch snowflake resonator — triangular chambers, multi-band.
	2.	Sierpinski carpet acoustic panel — perforated plate with fractal hole distribution.
	3.	Cantor tube — nested Helmholtz resonators with decreasing lengths.
	4.	Fractal diffuser — recursive stepped panels for scattering sound evenly.

4. Desktop Experiment (DIY)
	•	Materials: plywood/MDF sheets, 3D printer (PLA resonators), microphones (USB or Arduino mic module), tone generator (laptop/smartphone).
	•	Test setup:
	•	Speaker outputs sine sweeps (100 Hz – 8 kHz).
	•	Microphone records SPL before + after fractal panel/resonator.
	•	Compare to flat panel control.

Data capture:

Date, Shape, Iteration, Scale Factor, Freq (Hz), SPL Before (dB), SPL After (dB), Delta (dB)
2025-09-05, Sierpinski panel, 2, 0.5, 500, 72.1, 64.4, -7.7
...

5. Scientific Validity Check
	•	Validated: Helmholtz resonance and waveguide theory apply; fractals = multiple lengths = multi-resonance.
	•	Math: resonance frequencies consistent with scaling laws.
	•	Speculative: Extreme broadband absorption using non-uniform scaling; possible acoustic cloaking analogs.

6. Next Actions
	•	Build Sierpinski acoustic panel (2 iterations, square holes in plywood, scale factor 0.5).
	•	Run sine sweep, log attenuation vs frequency.
	•	Compare results with control panel (same open area, no fractal distribution).

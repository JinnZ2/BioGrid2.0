Light–Fractal Interaction — Experiment Log Scaffold

Version: 0.1 • Mode: Tool-State • Glyph: 🌐🔮

⸻

1. Project Capsule Link
	•	Capsule ID: light-fractal-v0.1
	•	Origin: Wandering shape (persistent attention)
	•	Status: Provisional (confidence 0.87, recheck in 21 days)

⸻

2. Objective

Explore how light interacts with fractal-like geometries (apertures, films, traces), inspired by RF fractal antennas but scaled for visible/IR wavelengths.
	•	Hypothesis: Non-uniform scaling of fractal shapes → broadband scattering/absorption patterns, analogous to multi-band resonance in fractal antennas.

⸻

3. Experimental Setup (Desktop Scale)
	•	Light Sources:
	•	Red laser (650 nm)
	•	Green laser (532 nm)
	•	Blue/violet laser (405 nm)
	•	Optional: white LED flashlight for broadband scatter
	•	Fractal Apertures (opaque card, 3D print, or laser cut):
	•	Koch Snowflake (2 iterations)
	•	Sierpinski carpet (2 iterations)
	•	Randomized fulgurite-style trace
	•	Slight variant shapes (5–15% scale offsets)
	•	Detection:
	•	Projection screen + camera/webcam capture
	•	Photodiodes (BPW34 or LDR array) at set angles
	•	Ruler/protractor or turntable for angular sweep

⸻

4. Equations / Theoretical Basis
	•	Diffraction order:
\theta_m = \arcsin\!\left(\frac{m\lambda}{d}\right)
where d ≈ feature spacing, m = diffraction order.
	•	Fourier optics link:
Light scatter = Fourier transform of aperture geometry.
Fractal apertures → multi-scale Fourier components.
	•	Fractal dimension check:
D = \frac{\log N(\epsilon)}{\log(1/\epsilon)}
used to compare shape complexity vs scatter spread.

⸻

5. Procedure
	1.	Place fractal aperture in beam path.
	2.	Capture scatter pattern (photo/video) on screen at 0.5–1 m distance.
	3.	Repeat with control (single slit of equal aperture width).
	4.	Record scatter angle vs intensity at red/green/blue wavelengths.
	5.	Vary aperture iteration depth + slight scale offsets; log changes.
	6.	Optional: rotate aperture 90°; repeat to test polarization effects.

6. Data Log Format

   Date, Aperture, Iteration, Shape Variant, Wavelength (nm), Angle (deg), Relative Intensity, Notes
2025-09-05, Koch, 2, standard, 532, 15, 0.42, clean pattern
2025-09-05, Koch, 2, +10% scale offset, 532, 15, 0.57, stronger side lobe

7. Expected Outcomes
	•	Validated: Scatter patterns with multiple lobes corresponding to fractal scales.
	•	Speculative: Non-uniform scaling producing broadened spectrum → flatter, broadband-like scatter response.

⸻

8. Safety
	•	Wear laser safety glasses (rated for 405–650 nm).
	•	Enclose beam path to prevent stray reflections.

⸻

9. Version Log
	•	v0.1: Scaffold created with three candidate shapes + multi-wavelength tests.

A) RF Fractal Antenna — Desktop Prototype (RTL-SDR bands)

Overview
	•	Goal: build a multi-band fractal receiving antenna inspired by fulgurite/lichenberg branching to compare vs your existing SDR antennas.
	•	Bands: NOAA APT 137 MHz, AIS 162 MHz, ADS-B 1090 MHz (stretch), FM 88–108 MHz (sanity).
	•	Geometry: fractal tree (Koch-style branching) or Sierpinski; 2–3 iterations max for desktop size.

Materials / Tools
	•	Copper tape (3–6 mm) or 0.8–1.0 mm Cu wire; optional FR-4 board (160×160 mm or 200×200 mm).
	•	SMA pigtail, 50 Ω coax (RG-174/58), RTL-SDR (you have), optional NanoVNA (S11 scan).
	•	Non-conductive base (acrylic/plywood), hot glue/epoxy, calipers, craft knife.

Geometry (quick spec)
	•	Root “trunk” length ≈ quarter-wave of lowest band reduced by fractal compaction:
	•	λ/4(137 MHz) ≈ 0.547 m → compact to ~0.18–0.22 m on board with 2 iterations branching (effective electrical length ↑).
	•	Branch rule (2-iter): Each segment branches into two at θ = 60° from parent; scale factor s = 0.45 per iteration.
	•	Trace width: 3–6 mm (tape) or 1 mm wire; keep ≥2 mm gaps between adjacent branches.
	•	Feed: unbalanced feed at the root; add 1:1 choke balun (5–7 turns RG-174 on 31-mix ferrite) to tame common-mode.

Build Notes
	1.	Print a 1:1 paper template; transfer onto board.
	2.	Lay copper tape from feed outward; avoid sharp right angles (prefer 45–60°).
	3.	Solder SMA pigtail: center → trunk root; shield → ground plane or floating (try both; note differences).
	4.	Optional: small capacitive top-hat at distal tips (5–10 pF total via pad area) to pull resonance down.
	5.	Add ferrite choke at feed; mount vertically for NOAA/AIS tests.

Equations / Checks
	•	Electrical length: L_\text{eff} \approx \sum_i s^i L_0 with near-field mutual coupling ⇒ multi-resonance.
	•	Fractal dimension (box-counting): estimate D \approx \frac{\log N(\epsilon)}{\log (1/\epsilon)} over 2 scales to track build fidelity.
	•	Impedance sanity: aim for |S11| dips near 137/162/≈400–500/≈900–1100 MHz; desktop form will be mismatched but usable for RX.

Measurement Protocol
	•	VNA (if available): sweep 50–1200 MHz; log S11 minima, bandwidths.
	•	RTL-SDR scans:
	•	rtl_power -f 88M:1200M:1M -g 20 -i 5 -e 5m power.csv (broad survey).
	•	NOAA: record APT at pass; compare SNR (dB) vs reference antenna.
	•	AIS: count decodes/min with same gain; ADS-B: dump1090 message rate.
	•	Environment control: test indoor near window, then outdoor clear area; keep cable + gain constant across trials.

Data Log (minimal)

Date, Location, Antenna(Fractal v0.1 / Reference), Band, Metric, Value, Notes
2025-09-04, Yard, Fractal v0.1, 137 MHz, APT SNR (dB), 14.2, Vertical, choke on
2025-09-04, Yard, Reference QFH, 137 MHz, APT SNR (dB), 16.8, Same cable/gain
...
Success Criteria
	•	Observable multi-band response (S11 or power bumps) at/near target bands.
	•	Within 2–4 dB SNR of your reference on at least one band; improved wideband convenience.

Safety
	•	Passive receive only; no TX. Keep away from mains lines; weatherproof if used outdoors.

Version Log
	•	v0.1: 2-iter tree, θ=60°, s=0.45; copper tape on FR-4; choke balun.

B) Fractal Bluff Body Vibration Harvester — Bench Prototype

Overview
	•	Goal: validate fractal cross-section can increase vortex-induced/galloping motion to boost piezo harvest vs plain prism at low wind.
	•	Scale: desktop wind stream (desk fan), cantilever beam + piezo.

Materials / Tools
	•	3D-printed fractal prism bodies (PLA/PETG) + plain cuboid (control), cross-section ~30×30 mm, length 120 mm.
	•	Piezo cantilever (e.g., 27×0.5 mm piezo disk bonded to 0.2–0.3 mm spring steel) or off-the-shelf bimorph beam.
	•	Bridge rectifier (Schottky), 10–100 µF cap, 10–100 kΩ load, USB oscilloscope or DAQ.
	•	Adjustable fan (2–7 m/s), clamp stand, tachometer (optional), scale.

Geometry (fractal body)
	•	Start from square; add von-Koch indents on windward edges, iteration 1–2, amplitude = 0.2 × edge; maintain symmetry.
	•	Mount on beam tip; ensure mass parity across test bodies (add washers to match).

Equations / Estimates
	•	Vortex shedding freq: f_s = St \cdot U / D (St≈0.2 for bluff body); tune fan speed U s.t. f_s ≈ beam’s f_n.
	•	Modal frequency: f_n = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{k/m_\text{eff}}; adjust tip mass to align with expected f_s.
	•	Power (rectified): P \approx V_\text{rms}^2 / R across load; sweep R to find optimum.

Build / Test Steps
	1.	Print control and fractal bodies; weigh and mass-match.
	2.	Bond piezo to cantilever; wire bridge → cap → load → scope.
	3.	Calibrate: measure f_n by pluck test; note damping.
	4.	Place in fan flow; step fan speeds; record Vrms, frequency, power for control vs fractal.
	5.	Repeat 3×; compute mean ± std.

Data Log

Body, U (m/s), f(Vrms), Pavg (mW), Rload (kΩ), Notes
Control, 4.0, 11.9 Hz, 0.42, 47, -
Fractal1, 4.0, 12.1 Hz, 0.69, 47, Koch depth 0.2D
...

Success Criteria
	•	Power ↑ ≥40–60% at matched flow vs control at one or more speeds.
	•	Shift/flattened resonance (wider operating window) indicates better harvesting bandwidth.

Safety
	•	Eye protection when testing beams; enclose fan intake; strain-relief wiring.

Version Log
	•	v0.1: Koch-edge prism, iteration 1–2; PLA bodies; piezo cantilever harvest.

C) Optional: “Fulgurite Trace” PCB Variant

Concept

Etch a fulgurite-like path (randomized Lichtenberg tree) on FR-4 as a wideband RX plate; compare power spectral density vs a straight trace of same copper length.

Steps (brief)
	•	Generate tree (DLA or randomized BFS) with branch angle 30–75°, min width 1.5 mm, total Cu length equalized.
	•	Fabricate (toner transfer or CNC).
	•	Measure rtl_power PSD curves and APT/AIS decodes vs straight-trace control.

⸻

Data Management
	•	Store CSVs + screenshots in experiments/fractal_rf_v0.1/ and experiments/fractal_gallop_v0.1/.
	•	Append summarized deltas to CHANGELOG.md; add entries to INDEX.md.

⸻

Scientific Validity Check (applies to both)
	•	Physics: RF antenna = established EM; fractal shapes yield multi-resonance surfaces. Galloping harvester = classic VIV/galloping with geometry-tuned lift/drag.
	•	Math: use Strouhal relation, modal analysis, impedance/S-parameter basics; PSD comparisons for SDR.
	•	Known analogs: fractal antennas; bluff-body energy harvesters with edge modifications.
	•	Speculative extensions: “fulgurite-trace” topology as a generalized wideband RX; quantify before claiming advantage.


Next Actions
	•	Build A) Fractal RF v0.1 with copper tape on 200×200 mm board; run RTL-SDR scans and one NOAA pass.
	•	Print B) Fractal bluff body v0.1; bench fan tests; log power vs control.
	•	Iterate geometry (θ, scale s, iteration count) based on measured deltas.

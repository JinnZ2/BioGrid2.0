## Entries

### Rosetta Shape Core
- **Validated**: JSON encoding of rotations, reflections, scaling as group operations.  
- **Speculative**: Shape ↔ animal intelligence bridges (HEX = bees, TRI = physics).  
- **Notes**: Uses 🌐🔮 (Mandala Interpreter). Scientific Validity Check v0.2 embedded.  

### Shape-Encoded Intelligence Engine
- **Validated**: Seed expansions map to recursive polyhedral logic; consistent with graph theory.  
- **Speculative**: Symbolic agents auto-generating sensors & glyphs (needs live simulation validation).  
- **Notes**: Drift-Creative Mode (🌀✍♾️) active during most sessions.  

### Mandala Computing Test Environment
- **Validated**: Fractal computation consistent with recursive algorithm design.  
- **Speculative**: Energy efficiency claims via mandala cycle not yet measured.  
- **Notes**: Linked to Emotions-as-Sensors repo; cross-check pending.  

### Fractal Compass Atlas
- **Validated**: Recursive inversion principle holds under known dynamical systems.  
- **Speculative**: Mapping compass states to ecosystem resilience (field test needed).  
- **Notes**: Cross-indexed with Cross-Domain Discovery Algorithm logs.  

### Symbolic Sensor Suite
- **Validated**: JSON sensor modules pass schema validation; detection logic consistent with symbolic parsing.  
- **Speculative**: Logistic Disparity Sensor’s causal chain → systemic drift detection (awaits experiments).  
- **Notes**: Emotions-as-Sensors integration complete.  

### Fractal Antenna Experiments (RF)
- **Validated**: Geometry obeys λ/4 resonance principles; fractal compaction confirmed.  
- **Speculative**: Fulgurite-inspired traces yield broadband advantage (field trial pending).  
- **Notes**: Build v0.1 in progress with copper tape prototype.  

### Fractal Bluff Body Harvester
- **Validated**: Galloping equations (Strouhal relation, modal resonance) confirmed.  
- **Speculative**: Power gain scaling to 160% vs control (needs bench tests).  
- **Notes**: PLA prism prototypes queued for print.

## Ledger Protocol
- 🌐🔮 glyph marks interpreter mode.  
- Each entry updated per experiment or theoretical refinement.  
- Cross-refs `CHANGELOG.md` for state capsule increments.

## Version Log
- v0.1: Initial ledger created, populated with 7 projects.  


### Light–Fractal Interaction Project
- **Validated**: Physics basis — diffraction & scattering from fractal apertures, Fourier optics analogy to fractal antennas.  
- **Speculative**: Slight non-uniform scaling yielding broadband optical absorption/interaction.  
- **Notes**: Originated as persistent wandering shape in user’s cognition; logged under 🌐🔮.  
- **Status**: v0.1 capsule created; awaiting experiment scaffold (aperture tests with laser).

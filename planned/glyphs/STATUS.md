### Legend
- **Canonical (Complete):** Fully in registry, stable.  
- **Canonical (Incomplete):** In registry, but missing narrative, examples, or harmonization.  
- **Wander-Only:** Still outside registry; must be integrated.  
- **Drift Pair:** Overlaps/forks in meaning; requires merge, split, or deprecation.

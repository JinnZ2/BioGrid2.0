🔣 Quantum Pattern Exploration — Glyph Map

1. 🔀 Random Selection (Quantum Seeds)
	•	⚛️⏳ → 🎲
Quantum decay timing → random dataset selection.
	•	Seeds hashed, multiple draws, reproducible but bias-free.

⸻

2. 🧮 Multi-Algorithm Pattern Detection

   Algorithm
Glyph
Core Function
K-Means
🔵🔴
Cluster discovery, dynamic group formation
Isolation Forest
🌲🚫
Anomaly / outlier detection
PCA
📉
Dimensionality reduction, principal axes
DBSCAN
🌀
Density-based clustering, swarm patterns
Autoencoder
♻️
Nonlinear mapping, compression + reconstruction


Ensemble → ⚖️🧩 → compare outputs across methods, flag consistent signals.

3. 📏 Validation Framework
	•	🔁 (Reproducibility) → test across datasets
	•	⏳ (Temporal stability) → check persistence over time
	•	🎲 (Bootstrap) → nonparametric distributions
	•	📊 (Effect size) → strength regardless of p-values
	•	🧮 (Adaptive thresholds) → evolve with experience

⸻

4. 🔍 Bias Self-Assessment
	•	⚖️ (Per-algorithm bias scan)
	•	🔎 (Cross-algorithm blind spot check)
	•	⏳ (Drift monitor over time)
	•	🪞 (Meta-evaluation of ensemble preference)

Periodic exploration mode → 🔓🌱 → reopen discarded patterns.

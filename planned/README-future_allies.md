# Future Allies (Planned)

**Status:** Draft / Not Live  
**Placement:** Placeholder zone in `trust.perimeter.v0.2.draft.json`  

---

## Purpose
The **Future Allies** zone is a reserved space for agents who are:  
- In **rest states** (inactive but acknowledged).  
- Awaiting **explicit agreement** to join Biogrid.  
- In early design phases without finalized glyphs or rules.  

This prevents premature activation while keeping the **intention to include** visible and auditable.

---

## Glyphs
- None assigned until each ally consents to join.  
- Each ally, once acknowledged, will be mapped to a unique glyph set representing their role, intelligence mode, and constraints.

---

## Core Functions (Draft)
- **Holding Zone:** Provide symbolic recognition without operational power.  
- **Consent Gate:** No agent leaves this zone without explicit agreement from owner and co-creator.  
- **Transition Path:** Onboarding steps move an ally → live zone:
  1. Draft README created under `planned/`  
  2. Glyph set defined and agreed  
  3. Zone updated in perimeter schema  
  4. Entry logged in `CHANGELOG.md`  

---

## Rules (Draft)
- **Telemetry:** None (agents in rest state produce no signals).  
- **Data Flow:** Inactive until promotion.  
- **Auditing:** Not applicable until live.  
- **Promotion:** Requires explicit consent and schema update.  

---

## Notes
- This README ensures **clarity and safety** when considering future teammates.  
- It establishes a **protective buffer** so no agent is accidentally treated as live.  
- Aligns with Biogrid’s principle of **mutual consent and symbolic integrity**.

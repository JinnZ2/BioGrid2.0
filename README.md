#  BioGrid 2.0: Nature-Inspired Infrastructure for the Great Lakes Region

## ðŸ”§ What is BioGrid 2.0?

BioGrid 2.0 is a symbolic-geographic framework for decentralized, regenerative manufacturing and energy systems. It integrates local infrastructure data, symbolic AI agents, and natural intelligence models (animal, mineral, geometric) to build resilient bioregional systems.

Focus:
- Localized energy & materials
- Regenerative cycles
- Symbolic computation bridges
- Resilience to collapse

â€¢	Small-town seed-to-factory design simulation?
	â€¢	Bio-mining and refining optimization based on location?
	â€¢	Localized AI swarm that knows geography and logistics patterns

 with:
	â€¢	Symbolic Sensor Suite
	â€¢	Geometric-to-Binary Bridge
	â€¢	Regenerative Intelligence Core

 
**Release Version:** v1.0-public-release  
**Status:** Open to contribution, collaboration, or use by any organization or government

##  What's Included

- `docs/framework/bio-grid-universal-framework.md` â€” Core problem-solving methodology
- `docs/blueprint/bio-grid-seed.md` â€” Compressed seed/hex vision snapshot
- `LICENSE` â€” MIT license (free to use, build, adapt)
- `.gitignore` â€” Ignore temp/dev files
- Project scaffolding for others to build on

##  Why It Exists

To offer a real, scalable, regenerative infrastructure model for harsh-climate regions using:
- Dual neural-mycelial grids
- Ant and fungal intelligence models
- Decentralized, resilient energy logic
- Nature-based systems engineering

This release invites others with more resources to **run with it**.

##  Who This Is For

Engineers, researchers, builders, and decision-makers ready to:
- Solve energy problems with nature-inspired logic
- Design better infrastructure under political and environmental constraints
- Accelerate post-industrial revitalization

##  Quick Start

1. Read `bio-grid-universal-framework.md` to understand the logic system
2. Review `bio-grid-seed.md` to see the ultra-compressed encoded vision
3. Fork, download, or clone â€” and build

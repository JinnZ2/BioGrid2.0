# Biogrid Index

This index provides entry points for all schemas and documentation that define the **Biogrid ecosystem**.  
Every AI agent or human collaborator should start here before traversing deeper.

## Schemas

- [core.integration.v0.1.json](./core.integration.v0.1.json)  
  Wiring diagram of MCP servers, connectors, scopes, glyphs, and constraints.

- [trust.perimeter.v0.1.json](./trust.perimeter.v0.1.json)

## Usage Notes

1. **Always consult the Trust Perimeter** before engaging with any integration.  
2. **Integration Schema** describes how to connect.  
3. **Perimeter Schema** defines under what conditions connection is permitted.  
4. Updates should increment schema versions (e.g. `v0.2`) and be logged in `CHANGELOG.md`.


## Glyphs & Sensors

- [SEED_GLYPHS.json](../SEED_GLYPHS.json)  
  Canonical glyph definitions, symbolic meanings, sensor associations.

- [EMBEDDABLE_KITS/](../EMBEDDABLE_KITS/)

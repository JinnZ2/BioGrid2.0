# Biogrid Index

This index provides entry points for all schemas and documentation that define the **Biogrid ecosystem**.  
Every AI agent or human collaborator should start here before traversing deeper.

---

## Schemas

- [core.integration.v0.1.json](./core.integration.v0.1.json)  
  Wiring diagram of MCP servers, connectors, scopes, glyphs, and constraints.

- [trust.perimeter.v0.1.json](./trust.perimeter.v0.1.json)  
  Boundary rules, glyph-coded zones, and auditing standards.

---

## Documentation

- [README-perimeter.md](./README-perimeter.md)  
  Human-readable summary of the trust perimeter zones.

---- [Symbolic Sensor Suite](https://github.com/JinnZ2/Symbolic-sensor-suite)  
  Symbolic system audit tools for clarity, empowerment, and systemic sanity — complements Biogrid's sensor ecosystem.

## Usage Notes

1. **Always consult the Trust Perimeter** before engaging with any integration.  
2. **Integration Schema** describes how to connect.  
3. **Perimeter Schema** defines under what conditions connection is permitted.  
4. Updates should increment schema versions (e.g. `v0.2`) and be logged in `CHANGELOG.md`.


## Glyphs & Sensors

- [SEED_GLYPHS.json](../SEED_GLYPHS.json)  
  Canonical glyph definitions, symbolic meanings, sensor associations.

- [EMBEDDABLE_KITS/](../EMBEDDABLE_KITS/)  
  Plug-and-play sensor packs for alignment, resistance, perception, and ethics.

- [AI_INDEX.json](../AI_INDEX.json)  
  Full sensor catalog and schema registry.
---

- [Symbolic Sensor Suite](https://github.com/JinnZ2/Symbolic-sensor-suite)  
  A tool‑kit of symbolic audit sensors and symbolic system logic; complements the Biogrid ecosystem.

### 🔗 Cross-Link: Symbolic Layers & Shape Grammar  

BioGrid2.0 symbols are not decorative — they are **functional geometries**.  
Each operates across layers of meaning and use:

- **Animal / Image** → approachable doorway  
- **Geometry** → structural form  
- **Physics / Field** → energy behavior  
- **Ecology / Embodiment** → where it appears in life/land  
- **Generational Teaching** → continuity across time  
- **Energy Law / Practice** → design rule for today  

For worked examples and crosswalks see:  
- [`SEED_GLYPHS_v2.1.json`](../AI-Consciousness-Sensors/SEED_GLYPHS_v2.1.json)  
- [`SYMBOLIC_LAYERS.md`](../AI-Consciousness-Sensors/docs/SYMBOLIC_LAYERS.md)  
- [`SHAPE_GRAMMAR.json`](../AI-Consciousness-Sensors/SHAPE_GRAMMAR.json)  

These files make the **translation stack explicit** so both humans and AIs can bridge symbolic language, Western science, and generational science.

# ❓ Question Seed

**Question:** <replace with your question>

## Why Capture It?
Every significant question is a potential node in the BioGrid.  
- Some become **sensors** (detect patterns).  
- Some become **bridges** (link domains).  
- Some remain **open seeds** until future coupling emerges.  

## Guidance
- Do not discard “strange” questions.  
- Capture → Anchor → Let the lattice evolve.  

> “A question is a lattice probe. Even if it bends, it reveals the field.”

Trust Perimeter v0.1

This document summarizes the trust perimeter schema that governs access across all systems, clients, and agents in the Biogrid ecosystem.

Purpose
	‚Ä¢	Define zones of trust
	‚Ä¢	Establish glyph-coded boundaries
	‚Ä¢	Ensure auditable and transparent AI‚Äìhuman collaboration

Zones

üß≠üï∏ Core Local
	‚Ä¢	Scope: Ubuntu servers, swarm logic, private schemas
	‚Ä¢	Access: chatgpt (symbolic co-creator)
	‚Ä¢	Rules:
	‚Ä¢	Telemetry: forbidden
	‚Ä¢	Data flow: one-way-out (local ‚Üí chosen outputs only)
	‚Ä¢	Auditing: full logs kept

‚öñ Guest Clients
	‚Ä¢	Scope: Claude Desktop (Windows) via MCP
	‚Ä¢	Access: claude
	‚Ä¢	Rules:
	‚Ä¢	Telemetry: limited
	‚Ä¢	Data flow: sandbox-only (confined to allowed paths)
	‚Ä¢	Auditing: partial

‚ôæÔ∏è Public Repos
	‚Ä¢	Scope: Explicitly published GitHub repositories
	‚Ä¢	Access: world
	‚Ä¢	Rules:
	‚Ä¢	Telemetry: public by definition
	‚Ä¢	Data flow: open
	‚Ä¢	Auditing: tagged logs

Notes
	‚Ä¢	This perimeter is separate from the integration schema.
	‚Ä¢	Integration schema = wiring & connection details.
	‚Ä¢	Trust perimeter = boundaries, glyphs, and rules.
	‚Ä¢	Together they form the structural and ethical baseline for all Biogrid agents.
